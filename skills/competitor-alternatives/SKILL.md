## Core Framework

### 1. Competitive Keyword Mapping
**Impact: High**

Identify comparison search opportunities:

- Which competitors drive the most searches?
- What content types rank currently?

**Comparison Keyword Patterns:**
| Pattern | Example | Typical Volume |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| [X] vs [Y] | "Slack vs Teams" | Medium-High |
| [X] alternative | "Zoom alternatives" | High |
| [X] competitors | "Salesforce competitors" | Medium |
| Best [X] alternatives | "Best Asana alternatives" | Medium |
| [X] vs [Y] vs [Z] | "Monday vs Asana vs Notion" | Low-Medium |
| Switch from [X] | "Switch from Hubspot" | Low |

**Prioritization Matrix:**

- Competitor brand strength
- Your ability to compete
- Conversion potential

### 2. Page Type Selection
**Impact: High**

Choose the right format:
- What content type ranks for target keywords?

- How much detail is appropriate?
- What's the competitive density?

**Page Types:**

| Type | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Direct comparison (1v1) | [You] vs [Competitor] | Strong differentiators |
| Alternatives list | "[X] alternatives" | Less direct positioning |
| Best-of roundup | "Best [category] tools" | Category authority |
| Switching guide | "Switch from [X]" | Migration opportunity |
| Feature comparison | Specific feature vs | Feature advantage |

### 3. Competitive Positioning
**Impact: High**

Define your angle:
- What's your honest competitive advantage?
- Where do you genuinely excel?
- What use cases favor you?
- What's the fair comparison narrative?

**Positioning Approaches:**
| Approach | Example | Best When |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Feature superiority | "More features for less" | Clear feature lead |
| Price value | "Same power, 50% less" | Price advantage |
| Simplicity | "Powerful yet simple" | Ease of use |
| Specific use case | "Built for [niche]" | Specialization |
| Modern alternative | "The modern [X]" | Legacy competitor |

**Honesty Requirements:**

6. **Recommendation** (Best for X use case)

### 5. Feature Comparison Tables
**Impact: High**

Create effective comparison matrices:
- What features matter to buyers?

- Does it avoid bias?

**Table Best Practices:**

- Include pricing row
- Highlight recommended option

**Feature Selection:**
- Must-have features (parity check)
- Nice-to-have features (differentiation)
- Unique features (exclusive to you)
- Deal-breaker features (common requirements)

### 6. User Intent Matching
**Impact: High**

Align content with search intent:
- What does the searcher want to know?
- What stage are they in?
- What would convince them?
- What's their primary concern?

**Intent Signals:**
| Search | Intent | Content Need |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| "[X] vs [Y]" | Evaluation | Direct comparison |
| "[X] alternatives" | Exploration | Options overview |
| "[X] pricing vs [Y]" | Cost focus | Price comparison |
| "Switch from [X]" | Migration ready | Switching guide |
| "[X] review" | Validation | In-depth analysis |

### 7. Trust & Credibility
**Impact: Medium**

Build trust in comparison:
- Is the comparison fair and balanced?
- Are claims backed by evidence?
- Is bias acknowledged?
- Are sources cited?

**Trust Elements:**
- "Updated [date]" timestamp
