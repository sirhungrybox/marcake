## Core Framework

### 1. Cognitive Biases in Decision Making
**Impact: High**

Understand how people actually decide:

- What cognitive shortcuts are at play?
- How do we reduce cognitive load?

**Key Cognitive Biases:**

| Social proof | Follow what others do | Show user counts, reviews |
| Scarcity | Limited = valuable | Limited time/availability |
| Authority | Trust experts | Expert endorsements |
| Commitment | Consistency with past actions | Small yes → big yes |
| Reciprocity | Return favors | Give value first |

### 2. Persuasion Principles
**Impact: High**

Apply Cialdini's influence principles:
- What persuasion principle fits best?

**Cialdini's Principles:**

### 3. Emotional Triggers
**Impact: High**

Engage emotional decision-making:
- What emotions drive this purchase?
- How can we ethically evoke them?
- What emotional journey should users take?
- How do we balance emotion and logic?

**Emotional Drivers:**
| Emotion | Trigger | Marketing Context |
|---------|---------|-------------------|

- How many choices exist?
- What guides the decision?

**Choice Architecture Elements:**

**Defaults:**
- Default to the optimal choice
- Opt-out vs opt-in
- Pre-selected options

**Number of Options:**
- Too many = decision paralysis
- 3-4 options optimal
- Highlight recommended choice

**Decoy Effect:**

- Asymmetric dominance

**Framing:**

- Gains vs losses framing
- Per-day vs per-month pricing

### 5. Trust Building
**Impact: High**

Create conditions for trust:
- What creates initial trust?
- How is trust built over time?
- What might break trust?
- How transparent should we be?

**Trust Signals:**
| Signal | Example | Impact |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Social proof | Reviews, testimonials | High |
| Authority | Certifications, awards | Medium |
| Transparency | Clear pricing, policies | High |
| Risk reduction | Guarantees, free trials | High |
| Familiarity | Recognizable elements | Medium |
| Personalization | Relevant content | Medium |

**Trust Building Sequence:**
1. Initial credibility (who are you?)
2. Proof of claims (can you deliver?)
3. Risk mitigation (what if it doesn't work?)
4. Value delivery (prove it works)
5. Relationship building (ongoing trust)

### 6. Motivation & Behavior Change
**Impact: Medium**

Understand what drives action:
- What motivates the target behavior?

- How can we make action easier?
- What triggers behavior?

**Fogg Behavior Model:** B = MAT
